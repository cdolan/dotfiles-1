# Bash prompt config

## Install

**1.** Install with `install.sh` to clone and setup using `curl`, or alternatively just clone the repo and run the `dotfiles/bash_prompt/setup.sh` script.
```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fehawen/dotfiles/master/bash_prompt/install.sh)
```

**Note:** The setup script will clone this repo, so make sure to run the `curl` command from whichever directory you want this repo to be located in.

**2.** Install your preferred [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) font, preferrably [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and set it as default in your terminal. This is required in order to enable ligatures, unless you enable ligatures by other means based on which terminal you're using.

**3.** Done.
