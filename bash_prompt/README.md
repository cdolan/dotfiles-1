# Bash prompt config

## Install

**1.** Run the `setup.sh` script inside the `bash_prompt/` folder.
```bash
./setup.sh
```

**2.** Install your preferred [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) font, preferrably [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and set it as default in your terminal emulator. This is required in order for the *git branch* icon to display properly.

**3.** Done.
